<h2> --- 2024 -- </h2>

<p>The <em>Chief Historian</em> is always present for the big Christmas sleigh launch, but nobody has seen him in months! Last anyone heard, he was visiting locations that are historically significant to the North Pole; a group of Senior Historians has asked you to accompany them as they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.</p>
<p>As each location is checked, they will mark it on their list with a <em class="star">star</em>. They figure the Chief Historian <em>must</em> be in one of the first fifty places they'll look, so in order to save Christmas, you need to help them get <em class="star">fifty stars</em> on their list before Santa takes off on December 25th.</p>
<p>Collect stars by solving puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants <em class="star">one star</em>. Good luck!</p>
